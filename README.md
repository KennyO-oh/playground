# Welcome to my simulation coding hub!<br><br>
## The https://github.com/kenny-oh/playground repository hosts my entire mixture of HTML and Python scripts.<br><br>
### For the HTML files, all you have to do is go to your address bar and plug in the file name at the end of `https://kennyo-oh.github.io/playground/`...
- For example: https://kennyo-oh.github.io/playground/t-cflow.html
### For the Python files, you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is what I use.
<br>
These simulations derive their motion or evolution from real-world physics calculations/computations!

`pycradle.html` sidenote: it was built using VPython and converted to GlowScript, and it is the more polished version of `jscradle.html|cradle.js`
