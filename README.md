# Welcome to my simulation coding hub!<br><br>
## The https://github.com/kenny-oh/playground repository hosts my entire mixture of HTML and Python scripts.<br><br>
### For the HTML files, all you have to do is go to your address bar and plug in the file name at the end of https://kennyo-oh.github.io/playground/...
- For example: https://kennyo-oh.github.io/playground/t-cflow.html
### For the Python files, you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is what I use.
<p>Admittedly, much of this spawned from my AI training project, which involved prompting the bot for an "aesthetically pleasing" simulation/animation that derived all of its motion or evolution from real, calculated physics formulas, laws, principles, and phenomena. Then, also, providing the code for it to learn from.</p><br>
